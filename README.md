# Linear-Regression-from-Scratch

This project implements Linear Regression using Gradient Descent without relying on external ML libraries like Scikit-learn. It uses only NumPy and Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for visualization.

The dataset used is Salary Data.csv, which contains Years of Experience and corresponding Salary values. The model is trained to predict salaries based on years of experience.
